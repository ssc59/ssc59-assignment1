                    <li><strong>2021 — Team Formation:</strong>I established the <em>Pittsburgh Women’s Cricket Team, which became the official space for women cricketers to meet, practice, and play in the city. This was part of a movement toward inclusivity and opportunity in a sport I love.</em></li>
                    <li><strong>2022 — First Championship:</strong> Only a year from that first practice, our team had won the league championship after our first year competing.  A reflection of all the hard work, the bond we created, and the connection we developed together from start to finish.</li>
                    <li><strong>2023 — National Exposure:</strong> I was fortunate to train and play alongside members of the U.S. Women’s Cricket Team, gaining exposure at the national-level and improving my skills from experience with high-caliber athletes.</li>
                    <li><strong>2024 — Leading Run Scorer:</strong> As a player and a team leader, my commitment was evident when I became the tournament's leading run scorer in Pittsburgh, demonstrating again that hard work, consistent effort, and perseverance can lead to success.</li>
                    <li><strong>2025 — Historic Recognition:</strong> This journey came complete with my recognition for starting first women’s cricket team in Pittsburgh—an honor highlighting not just my accomplishments, but more importantly that I opened up doors for many women in the community.</li>
