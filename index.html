                    Cricket has been more than just a game for me—it has formed my journey as a leader, athlete, and changemaker. What began as a personal passion quickly evolved into an act of service when I recognized the limited opportunities for women to play cricket in Pittsburgh. Instead of waiting for something to happen, I sought out to create change. I’m proud to have created the women’s first-ever cricket team in Pittsburgh. This experience was more than an opportunity for me to lead. It enabled so many women, like myself, to compete, excel, and follow their passion. Building this team from scratch was challenging—it meant trying to recruit players, organizing practice times, arranging logistics, and even developing interest in a community that is still new to cricket. But the challenges we faced became opportunities to show resilience and creativity. Through our team, I learned how to take on a leadership role by uniting women from different backgrounds to create an environment of support and mutual growth on and off the field.
                    Our team has evolved into more than just a sport—we are representatives of inclusivity, determination, and the strength of women working together to break barriers. For me, cricket is not just about winning games, it is about leaving behind a legacy of empowerment and demonstrating that passion and perseverance can lead to real change.

                <article>
                    <p>
                        I am Srushti Chavan, and I am currently majoring in Information Science at the University of Pittsburgh. While school allowed me to grow my love towards technology and my test my ability as problem solver, cricket has been a space where I have been able to learn how to utilize teamwork, community, and competition in a meaningful manner. As the founder of Pittsburgh's first-ever women's cricket team, I have had the opportunity to take something that started with just me and observe a personal passion become more than just a passion, but a movement to create space for women to compete, support each other, and thrive. Cricket is not just about cricket for me; it is also about resilience-building, strengthening my own leadership, and activating community.

                        When I'm not on the pitch, I'm engaged in coding, design, fitness and music - these creative and invigorating passions have become an antidote to the rigors of my academic and athletic life. Coding helps me practice a problem-solving frame of mind; design encourages me to be creative; fitness reinforces discipline and resilience; and music instills focus and calm. Importantly, my hobbies differentiate and enhance my personal development while providing the physical energy, mental clarity, and confidence I carry with me on matchdays.
